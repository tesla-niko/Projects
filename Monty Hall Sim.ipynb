    "### Monty Hall Problem Simulation : \n",
    " Assume that a room is equipped with three doors. Two are empty(or say have goats) , and behind the third is a shiny new car. You are asked to pick a door, and will win whatever is behind it. Let's say you pick door 1. Before the door is opened, however, the host (Monty Hall) who knows what's behind the doors opens one of the other two doors, revealing that it is empty, and asks you if you wish to change your selection to the third door (i.e., the door which neither you picked nor he opened). The Monty Hall problem is deciding whether you do.  \n",
    "The problem can be extended to n doors with a car in one of the n doors. "
